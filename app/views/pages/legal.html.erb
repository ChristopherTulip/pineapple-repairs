					It all started with a fall on some black ice. Screen cracked, and LCD below, I was iPhone less, a feeling akin to being shoeless - everything was a little harder. Just one month after starting at SFU my connection to figuring out how to get around the campus, and organize my day was all gone, I found myself wondering if it was fixable, and how much it would be. A friend to told me to look it up on craigslist, the guy on the other line wanted $140, I told him “thanks”. I went to the Apple store and they wanted $229. So I opted for what I knew best, D.I.Y. I bought the parts on eBay, and watched Youtube Vidoes on how to do it. I wasn’t successful the first time around, but after a few go’s at it, I had a decent fix on my iPhone 3G.

					Soon though, I realized there was a market, others like me have experienced the pain of a broken device, and wondered what to do about it. I found myself brainstorming about launching my own repair shop, based completely online, that could be centered on my love for design and efficiency. I felt like the repair community at the time was really lacking in this area, and apparently this idea of a clean, simple, efficient repair for tech products connected with many people in the lower mainland. What started as an outlet for my passion and an entrepreneurial experiment quickly grew into much more than just fixing a few iPhone screens.

				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				
				<p>
					Going door to door is fun. You meet some amazing people, sip on a few glasses of wine, and occasionally play a hand or two. But there are downsides to all this fun. You’re not legitimate. No brick and mortar location meant no accountability. I could only take the business so far. The reputation and ability to create real change in the repair community was out of reach if I maintained mobile repairs. Plus let’s not forget the rain. It bears down on us, as though it doesn't already know the cold is going at us already, and the puddles are placed perfectly to get your pants and shoes wet. It was in February of 2009 that I decided it was time for a shop. We’ve moved from location to location since then, realizing the flaws in all, and have now settled at the historic Waterfront Station. It’s Vancouver’s transit hub, we have the Canada Line, Sky Train, and Seabus all making the station their final destination. I felt this would be the most convenient location for the majority of Vancouverites, and the neighboring suburbs.
