Live Consciously. Question Everything
<!-- <p>
	A few days ago I announced that I was <a href="/blogging/embarking-on-a-nomadic-life">embarking on a nomadic life</a>, leaving all the people and places I love behind for an undefined period of time. The overwhelming reaction to this has been that I'm "living the dream," and others wish they could do the same.  -->
<p>
	One of my discovered passions is provoking thought, conversation, and the imagination of others. I don't write or discuss in an attempt to convince them that my way of thinking or living is any better than any other way. I'm not so arrogant to believe that anything I believe is correct. It is, however, correct for me at this moment given the information I have. Present me with new information and I may just change my mind. Especially if you aren't trying to convince me of anything.
</p>

<h2>Question Life</h2>
<p>
	I didn't tell people the reasons <a href="/blogging/why-I-dont-drink">why I don't drink</a> in an attempt to shame others and make them stop drinking, but to get people to question their habits, and arrive at their life decision consciously. If alcohol is an overall positive force in your life, then fuck my opinions and down some JÃ¤gerbombs. All I ask is that you're not just doing it because it's a normal part of society and have never stopped to question it. 
</p>

<p>
	The same applies to everything else in your life. Are you taking a university degree/working a job because it's expected of you? Because you don't want to let your family down? Because you'd feel like a flake if you dropped out/quit? Fuck. That. I have friends that either stopped after high school, or even sooner, and have since become highly skilled, inspiring, and intellectual individuals. One is a white water rafting guide who travels the world, and is one of the wisest people I know. Another is a extremely sharp web developer, who is unfortunately also an Aussie (jokes). There's multiple paths to the same goal, quite often the road less travelled is faster and more rewarding.
</p>

<p>
	We all have so many options available to us, yet so many of us take the easy and defined routes. We choose to go to university and take a common degree. We graduate and apply for jobs that our list of skills -- that our university degrees supposedly gave us -- directly relate to. We eat 3 meals a deal, drink coffee, down alcohol, villianize drugs, desperately seek the love of a partner, and continuously seek a higher pay cheque. Have you ever thought about why you eat what you eat? Why you drink coffee and alcohol? Why you don't try acid, or go to a rave? Why you're desperately looking for acceptance from other people? Why you want kids, or want to get married? Why you work for someone else or do what you do? Or why you want more money, more stuff?
</p>

<p>
	<em>Again, I'm not saying you should change any of these things or accept my words as gospel</em>. Just ask yourself these questions, and more. You probably won't have an answer right away, but at least now you can start looking for it.
</p>

<h2>...and Religion</h2>

<p>
	I'm atheist, and have been for almost half my life. I have and have had religious friends. I would never attempt to convince them otherwise, nor would I not listen to their beliefs and dismiss them. Religion, despite my many problems with it, generally tries to instill high morals. I can never fault anything that makes people treat others with compassion. What bothers me is when people blindly follow their faith and use it to justify their ignorance and horrific behaviour. Shaming or killing LGBT individuals is not the Lord's work. It's just a way to feel comfortable with immense personal problems.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you were born Christian, Jewish, or Sikh, does not mean you can't follow another religion from another culture. Or hell, develop your own personal set of morals and beliefs that you strive to uphold. You don't need to believe in God(s) to be a spiritual person, just have the bravery to question your actions and your beliefs.

	Thanks for reading.
